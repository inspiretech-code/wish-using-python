# Birthday-Wish-using-Python
<h1>This is a Python wrapper for sending birthday wishes!</h1> 
Made by *Saim* Use this wrapper to send birthday wishes to your friend in a unique way using Python.  
Firstly, what do you have to do? You have to install the required packages, don't worry about the code and blabla things.
I made it simple for you.

<!--"""<h5>Watch the preview video before proceeding. You can watch it on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/smlSfCLHlS0) or directly in the [video link](https://youtu.be/smlSfCLHlS0).</h5>
""" -->
Download this wrapper, extract it, and open the folder. Open the terminal in this location, and run
# In case you are using your mobile, install the Termux app and follow method 2 named as ðŸ‘‰ There is another method to run.  Scroll down to see

**_pip install -r requirements.txt_**   

Don't forget to connect to the internet on your laptop (this will take a while).....  
Then make changes in the art files located in the 'arts' folder. I have provided plain art for you and plain art with extra decorations to add colors to your wish.    
Change the 'art file' in `config.py`; it is set to default, change it to 'plain art' or 'plain art with stars', where you made the changes and added colors.  
Follow the color codes to add colors.    

You can change the speed of art in `config.py` by reducing the 'speed' value to increase the speed of art. The same goes for coding speed too; 0.001 is the default value.

Finally, run the command:

**_python3 main.py_**        

in the terminal to see the art...  

<h1>There is another method to run</h1>
Open the terminal, copy and paste the command:

 **_git clone https://github.com/mssaim7777/wish-using-python.git_**
 
 Then run the following commands
 
 **_cd wish-using-python_**
 
 Install the requirements as mentioned before and follow the procedure because the same procedure starts from here...
 
 
  <h5>Disclaimer:-</h5>
        See the HELP.txt, if you want to make any changes in text in the art, like changing the name. Here, I put my friend's name, so edit it to your friend's name. I made all the sample alphabets there, so you can follow from that.
